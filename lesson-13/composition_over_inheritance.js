Exercise

Make the following enhancements:

Uber is a driver, and an app (with an .install() function)
DogSim2000 is an app and a barker (but not a pooper!)
Create instances, and trigger their functionality
driver's need fuel!
Add a showRemainingFuel() method
Add a refuel() method to top up
Change drive() to take away some fuel each time it is called
Test your changes out in node by running node index.js.
